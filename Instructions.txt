******************* SpamHater installation and instructions ********************

SpamHater is an ESMTP proxy service that becomes your first line of defense
against unwanted SMTP traffic.  It will overcome all the common tactics that
spammers use to bypass other e-mail filters, including MIME encoding the
message body, message fragmentation and character manipulation.  SpamHater
becomes your primary SMTP server and it will forward messages to your regular
e-mail server (a.k.a. SmartHost) if they pass the test.  File attachments are
not scanned.

SpamHater is an NT service.  Unzip the files on the computer where SpamHater
will be running.  Open a command prompt, change to the directory where SpamHater
is located and type "SMTPserv -i" then run the SMTPserv.reg file to install the
configuration keys into the registry.  Go to your Services list and configure
SpamHater (named SMTP Proxy) to start automatically.  It's also a good idea to
set SpamHater to restart on a crash just in case a spammer sends an improperly
formatted message.  Technically SpamHater should not crash for any reason
however, better safe than sorry.

SpamHater has some built in security features that will help prevent any
denial-of-service and virus attacks.  First, it will only allow a maximum of two
consecutive connections from any one IP address.  This prevents any one computer
from monopolizing all the active connections available without excessively
restricting legitimate e-mail servers with multiple messages to send.  Second,
if a single connection is sending multiple messages then it must wait for the
scanning process to complete in its entirety before sending another message.
This prevents a single connection from consuming all the system processing time
by sending lots of bogus messages.

--------- For installation on the same computer as your e-mail server ----------
Change the SMTP port that your e-mail server uses and change the SmartHostPort
setting in the registry to match.

------- For installation on a different computer than your e-mail server -------
Change the MX record in your DNS setting to reference the computer where
SpamHater is installed.  Wait a week to allow your DNS changes to be replicated
across the Internet then set your e-mail server to deny SMTP connections from
all but the SpamHater computer.  This is important because if you leave it open
some spammers will continue to use it and bypass SpamHater altogether.

------------------------------ Registry settings -------------------------------
Most of the registry settings are self explanatory.  There is no fancy
configuration utility because these settings will rarely change.  Ideally
SpamHater should be configured with the same options that your regular e-mail
server uses.  If you change any of the registry settings then you will need to
restart SpamHater before they take affect. The settings are:

UpdateLog:  1 = yes, 0 = no.  The log is very similar to Microsoft's Virtual
            SMTP server log, but also includes filter events for better
            monitoring of spam activity.

DeleteLogDays:  Number of days to retain old log files.  0 = unlimited.

SocketTimeout:  Number of seconds of inactivity before a client is disconnected.

PortNumber:  The port number that SpamHater listens to for incoming traffic.

MaxClients:  The maximum number of concurrent connections SpamHater will accept.
             SpamHater will only accept two concurrent connections per IP
             address to help prevent attacks.

MaxMessageSize:  The maximum message size in bytes that SpamHater will accept.
                 0 = unlimited, however setting a maximum size is a good way to
                 help prevent attacks.  Messages larger than this will be
                 truncated, the fragment that's received will be transmitted to
                 the recipient, and a note is attached letting the recipient
                 know it's a truncated message.

MaxLinkSize:  The maximum length of an HTML link in the both of the message.  If
              a link found within the message body it larger than this size then
              most likely it's a randomly generated link by a spammer designed
              to cause a buffer overflow.  Only the base address is examined and
              not any additional parameters that may be passed to the web
              server.  0 = unlimited size.  When this option is turn on then
              HTML links will also be examined for other deceptive formatting
              techniques, such as a ". ." within the link.  ForwardResolution
              configuration option must be turn on for this option to function.

MaxTrackingSize:  This is the maximum size, in records, that the tracking log
                  and outbreak log will reach.  When this size has been reached
                  then the oldest records with the lowest hit counts will be
                  deleted as needed to add new items to the lists.  This value
                  must be at least 1000.

SmartHost:  The address of your e-mail server.

SmartHostPort:  The SMTP port number of your e-mail server.

ForwardingAddress:  If you want any messages forwarded to someone for further
                    review, this is the address.

AdminAddress:  The e-mail address of the system administrator or postmaster.
               This is used on bounce back messages.

RejectIfFromInvalid:  1 = yes, 0 = no.  Reject e-mails if the value of the
                      "From:" key is blank or is an improperly formatted e-mail
                      address.  This is only related to the From: address in the
                      message itself and not the SMTP Mail From: command.

AcceptBlankMailFrom:  1 = yes, 0 = no.  According to the SMTP specifications,
                      servers are supposed to accept messages that contain a
                      blank address in the SMTP Mail From: command.  This format
                      is supposed to be used by servers to send non-delivery
                      reports.  Spammers will exploit this hole to get their
                      messages through.  There should be enough other details for
                      SpamHater to check to identify spam.  However, if you don't
                      mind missing a few non-delivery reports then turn this
                      option off.

AcceptBlankBody:  1 = yes, 0 = no.  This option is intended to reduce processing
                  time.  If a message hasn't been white listed or black listed by
                  the time SpamHater needs to scan the message body then it can
                  be automatically black listed if the message has no body.

ReverseResolution:  1 = yes, 0 = no.  This option is intended to reduce
                    processing time.  If the message hasn't been white listed or
                    black listed by the time SpamHater needs to scan the message
                    body then the results of the reverse resolution will be
                    checked against the domain filter and could be white or
                    black listed based on the result.  Reverse resolution is
                    also used for the Suspect Domain list so if this feature is
                    disabled then Suspect Domains will not work.

ForwardResolution:  1 = yes, 0 = no.  This option may increase processing time
                    a little, but it is worth it.  This option will perform a
                    forward lookup on all domains of all return addresses and
                    each of their subdomains, if necessary, as well as all HTML
                    links found in the message.  If any of the domains resolve
                    to a black listed IP address then the item is blocked.  This
                    option will not white list any message.  With this option a
                    spammers can keep purchasing as many domain names as they
                    like and reconfigure their DNS servers as many times as they
                    like.  If the return address or any of the links they include
                    in any of their spammed messages resolves to a black listed
                    IP range then their messages can easily be blocked.

RejectIfSameFromAndTo:  1 = yes, 0 = no.  Some spammers will use the recipients
                        e-mail address, as specified in the Rcpt To: command, as
                        the From address in the Mail From: command.  The spammer
                        is betting that you have your own domains on your White
                        list, which they should NOT be.  Instead you should have
                        the IP addresses you own on your White List because an IP
                        address is much more difficult to spoof.  This option
                        will Black List any e-mail that has the same address used
                        in both the Mail From: and Rcpt To: commands.  I've found
                        at least one extremely poorly configured e-mail server
                        that uses this technique for non-delivery reports.
                        However, in general, this option should be left on.

OutbreakCheck:  1 = yes, 0 = no.  This option will turn on a feature that will
                automatically black list IP addresses based on outbreak recipient
                addresses.  If any e-mail is delivered to a specified suspect
                recipient (also known a Honey Pot Addresses) then all future
                e-mail from that source will be black listed.  These automaticly
                black listed IP addresses will appear in the tracking log for
                review before they are manually put in the domain list file.  

RejectTags:  Some spammers use special header tags to track their messages.  If
             any e-mail contains any of the tags indicated here then it will be
             considered spam.  Separate the tag names with semi-colons and don't
             use any extra spaces.

EncodingLimit:  This indicates the maximum allowed characters that can be encoded
                within the e-mail message body.  Many spammers will try to
                conceal their HTML links by encoding the characters with
                %-encoding and/or &#-encoding methods.  This form of encoding is
                completely unnecessary for alphanumeric characters.  If too many
                alphanumeric characters have been encoded this way then the
                message is black listed.  The only non-alphanumeric characters
                included in this count are the period and both slashes.  Set this
                option to zero to disable this check.

FormatErrors:  This indicates what to do with e-mails that are Black listed with
               the above two registry keys, the BLST command, and invalid From:
               address, a blank message body or a suspect domain violation.
               0 = send to TurfDir, 1 = forward to ForwardingAddress, 2 = delete.

AlternateRouting:  1 = yes, 0 = no.  This enables or disables a custom routing
                   method specific to Turbo Resources Int'l.

TempFilePath:  This is the directory SpamHater will use for temporary work files.
               This key MUST end with a backslash.  More information about this
               directory is in the Maintenance section below.

LogFilePath:  This is the directory where log files are stored.  This key MUST
              end with a backslash.

TurfDir:  This is the directory where filtered e-mail is stored for later review
          or retrieval.  This key MUST end with a backslash.

KeywordList:  This is the fully qualified directory path of your keyword filter
              list.  More information about this file is below and inside the
              file.

DomainList:  This is the fully qualified directory path of your domain filter
             list.  More information about this file is below and inside the
             file.

LocalDomains:  This is the fully qualified directory path of your local domain
               list.  Local domains are used to deny spammers from using your
               SMTP server as an open relay.  Only incoming traffic intended
               for recipients in the domains indicated in this file, and
               connections from your internal IP addresses indicated in this
               file, will be allowed.  If there are no entries in this file then
               SpamHater will accept all traffic and be an open relay.

               I found that many Spammers will use your SMTP server and make it
               appear as if you are sending them e-mail.  Their e-mail address
               is bogus, of course, so it bounces back to you with a full copy
               of the spam message.  When you open the bounce back report trying
               to figure out what you could have possibly sent to them, you see
               the spam.  Some viruses will also use this technique to conceal
               their real location.  Making sure your SMTP server isn't an open
               relay will prevent these problems.

TrackingLogFile:  This is the fully qualified directory path of a text file that
                  will be used to store IP address and domain tracking
                  information from all messages that are not white listed and
                  require a large amount of processing time.  This will help
                  identify IP address ranges and domains of spammers.  If the
                  file does not exist then SpamHater will create it.  If it does
                  exist then SpamHater will load the data from it and continue
                  to update the information.  The CTRK command will clear this
                  log, and LTRK will reload this log, without the need to
                  shutdown the server.

DNSBLSource:  If you wish to query spam identification services that use a
              standard DNSBL protocol then enter the domain addresses here.
              Separate the domain names with semi-colons and don't use any extra
              spaces.

DNSBLResults:  This indicates how the results from the above sources should be
               processed by stringing together Y's and N's indicating yes or no
               if the result should black list the message.  For example, if you
               enter NNYN then it means if the matching DNSBL source above
               returns 127.0.0.3 then the message should be black listed.  You
               need a different result set for each of the sources listed in the
               above registry key.  Separate the result sets with semi-colons and
               don't use any extra spaces.

DNSBLAction:  This indicates what to do with e-mails that are Black listed with
              the above two registry keys.  0 = send to TurfDir, 1 = forward to
              ForwardingAddress, 2 = delete.

----------------------------- Configuration files ------------------------------
All three configuration files (above) are text files in a simple format.  If you
change a configuration file SpamHater will automatically detect the change and
reload the file.  Each configuration file contains more details about its
format.

You have the option to classify messages into three categories.  If a message is
found to have more that one classification then it's processed according to the
priority of its highest classification.  Black Listed items take the lowest
priority.  Permanent Black Listed items take the highest priority.  For example,
if a message if found to be on the White List then it will be processed as a
White Listed message unless it's also found to be on the Permanent Black List.
The Permanent Black List classification is a way for you to filter messages such
as viruses even if they come from a trusted source.

You also have the option to define Suspected Domains.  If and e-mail arrives
with a return address from a Suspected Domain then the sending IP address must
reverse resolve to any Suspected Domain or it will be black listed. For example,
IP addresses from MSN mail server typically resolve to hotmail.com.  If both
@hotmail.com and @msn.com are on the Suspected Domain list then if an e-mail
come in with an msn.com address the reverse resolution of the IP address must
match either msn.com or hotmail.com or it will be black listed.  This system
stops spam from commonly spoofed domains while allowing legitimate mail servers
to handle multiple domains.

You may also indicate Outbreak Recipients in the Domain Configuration file.
These addresses are also known as "Honey Pot Addresses".  Basically all messages
being sent to non-existent or no longer existing e-mail addresses are coming
from suspect sources.  These source IP addresses can be automatically black
listed to stop any more messages coming from that location.  These blocked IP's
are only temporarily stored in the outbreak list, but will be saved in the
Tracking Log for further review.

You may indicate White List Recipients.  These are recipients that will always
receive all e-mail, no matter how else the message is classified.  The message
is processed as normal, saved in the TurfDir etc.  However, if any of the
recipients are White List Recipients then a copy of the message will be
forwarded too.

You may indicate Disregarded Domains.  These are domains or IP addresses which
will not be added to the tracking log or outbreak filter, but are otherwise
ignored everywhere else.  For example, many messages formatting in HTML indicate
formatting rules may include a link to a W3C validation site.  You would not
want to white list or black list these sites, but ignore them so the message may
be rejected or approved by other markers.  You also would not want these sites
to be recorded in your tracking log producing unwanted clutter.

The LocalDomains file is already explained above.  The KeywordList file contains
key words and phrases that indicate spam, like "Free Visa".  The DomainList
contains domains of known spammers and keywords to look for in a return address
that may indicate a spammer, like "offers".  Both the KeywordList and DomainList
accept wildcards to stop spammers that use hundreds of sub-domains in their
return addresses, and various letter substitutions and misspellings in their
messages.  All message header keys that may indicate a return address are
scanned, such as "Reply-To:" and "Errors-to:"

There will never be a need to add keywords with more than one space between
words or letters.  All message fragmentation, including line breaks and extra
spaces, are removed from the message before the first keyword scan takes place.
Then all the HTML tags are removed, "&nbsp;"s are converted to spaces, and extra
spaces are removed again before the second keyword scan takes place.  This 
prevents spammers from using HTML comments to fragment the message.  MIME 
decoding is also done on text sections of the messages, because this is another
common trick spammers use to bypass filters.  File attachments are not scanned.
All messages are forwarded to your regular e-mail server in their original
format.  SpamHater will not change the message in any way, other than to attach
a note if it's truncated due to a size limit.  Delivery Status Notifications are
also sent to mail senders if SpamHater fails to forward the message to the
SmartHost.

------------------------------ New SMTP commands -------------------------------
You may notice a few new SMTP commands are available for administrators.  Here
is a quick overview of what they are:

STAT - This command is available from any connection.  It will give you an
       overview of processing times and Black/White list counts since the
       service was started.  It will give you a good idea about how efficiently
       your server and configuration files are working.

CSTA - This command is only available from an IP defined in the local domain
       list.  This command will reset all the statistical information displayed
       with the previous command.

KILL - This command is only available from an IP defined in the local domain
       list.  The parameter required for this command is the Connection ID.
       It will allow an administrator to force a connection to stop receiving
       data and immediately go to the processing stage.  If the connection has
       received any message data then an attachment will be added showing that
       the message is incomplete.  If no message data has been received then
       the connection is simply terminated.

EXIT - Same as QUIT command.

WLST - This command is only available from an IP defined in the local domain
       list.  The parameter required for this command is the Connection ID.
       It will allow an administrator to place the message associated with the
       connection on the White List.  If a message is exceptionally large and
       the processing stage is taking a long time, this is a good way to force
       the processing stage to end and deliver the message to its destination.

BLST - This command is only available from an IP defined in the local domain
       list.  The parameter required for this command is the Connection ID.
       It will allow an administrator to place the message associated with the
       connection on the Black List.  If a message is exceptionally large and
       the processing stage is taking a long time, this is a good way to force
       the processing stage to end and deliver the message to its destination.

CTRK - This command is only available from an IP defined in the local domain
       list.  This command will clear all data in the Tracking log without the
       need to shutdown the server..

LTRK - This command is only available from an IP defined in the local domain
       list.  This command will reload the Tracking log, if you make changes,
       without the need to shutdown the server.

STRK - This command is only available from an IP defined in the local domain
       list.  This command will save the Tracking log to a text file.

COBK - This command clears the outbreak list that contains IP addresses that
       have been automatically black listed based on outbreak recipients.

LCFG - This command will reload the server configuration values from the
       registry.  Some settings may still require the service to be restarted
       before they take affect.

HOLD - This command is only available from an IP defined in the local domain
       and will temporarily block all new connections except those from the
       local domain.  Issue this command a second time and new connections
       will be accepted again.  If an administrator needs to stop the service
       for any reason while a large amount of activity is occurring then this
       command will allow existing connections to finish processing while
       blocking new connections creating a break for the service to be stopped.

-------------------------- Maintenance and operation ---------------------------
Keeping up with spammers that attempt to bypass filters is important.  If you
belong to a specific industry then this process is easier because you can add
more things to your Black list.  For example, if you work in the restaurant
industry then you probably won't be getting any legitimate e-mail from car
dealers.  You can safely add domain names of car dealers and the industry
specific terms they use to your Black lists.  White lists are also used by
SpamHater.  Any e-mails found on a White list are automatically forwarded to the
intended recipient no matter how many Black list items it contains.  Be careful
with your White lists because spammers regularly use bogus return addresses
using major domains, like Yahoo.com and MSN.com, hoping to hit a White list
entry.

SpamHater can be setup to work any way you like but let me explain how I use it
to give you an idea about how I keep up with spammers.  First, I don't like to
delete anything.  The only items that get deleted are viruses that can be easily
identified by a specific subject line, such as "RE: Movie".  I can specify that
this keyword must be an exact match of only the subject line before it's
deleted.  Most of the filtered e-mail is set to the TurfDir.  I can scan these
files periodically and see if any legitimate mail is being filtered and retrieve
it.  It also gives me an idea about just how hard SpamHater is working for me.
All items set to the TurfDir include an extra text section at the top of the
file indicating who sent it and specifically what filter was used to block it.
With that information I can adjust my filter list to allow future e-mails from
that sender.

If I'm not sure about a filter I can always set it to forward the message to an
alternate address for further review.  For example, if someone uses "V1agra" or
"\/iagr4" then they are spammers trying to bypass spam filters.  However, if
someone uses "Viagra" then there is a chance it could be a legitimate e-mail.
That word could be used in a joke that's being forwarded around.

I also keep the logging turn on, although it's not required, because it's a
great help when troubleshooting problems.  The log will also indicate which
e-mails were sent because they were found on a White list, incase I wonder why
a certain e-mail got passed the filters.  Finally, you should check the
temporary directory periodically.  If SpamHater ever fails to forward a message
to the SmartHost, or to the TurfDir, then the temporary file will remain.  This
prevents the loss of messages due to problems.

------------------------------ Summing it all up -------------------------------
Now that you have an idea about the basic operation and configuration let me
piece it all together.  The first thing to know is that there are two phases of
scanning.  Phase 1 includes all the quick and easy checks that should only take
a split second to perform.  Phase 2 includes the more time consuming processes
such as scanning the message body.  This is also when you'll see a percent
complete indicated when viewing the results of the STAT command.  Phase 1 will
only stop before completion if the message is found to be on the permanent black
list.  This gives every message a chance to be white listed or permanently black
listed.  A vast majority of messages should be white or black listed in this
phase.  During Phase 2 the scanning could stop at any time the message is found
to be on the white or black lists in order to reduce the processing time.  If
the configurations files are setup properly only a small percentage of the
messages should get passed both Phase 1 and Phase 2 without being identified.

Please note that only text and HTML sections of the message are scanned.  File
attachments are ignored.  Also know that some spammers are marking messages as
written with alternate character sets.  This may give the appearance that the
whole message body is a file attachment when in fact SpamHater will identify it
as a text section and scan it anyway.  Also note that all the processes in
SpamHater are internal and will not modify the original message in any way.
Everything that SpamHater does and why can be logged and recorded for easy
management.  Knowing all this, these are the actions SpamHater takes given the
standard configuration setup:

*** Start ***
 1.  The connection is made from the client
 2.  The connecting IP address is checked against the IP ranges in the Domain
     Configuration file.  If the connection should be denied or if that same
     IP address is already connected more than one other time then it's
     immediately dropped.
 3.  All the SMTP commands that follow are recorded.  Basic e-mail address
     format validation checks are performed on all MAIL FROM: and RCPT TO:
     commands.
 4.  All RCPT TO: addresses are verified to be in the local Domain Configuration
     file.  If not, the connecting IP address must be in the local domain.  This
     prevents SpamHater from relaying messages.
 5.  The entire message is received and saved in the Temporary directory as
     indicated by the TempFilePath configuration option.
 6.  If the connection times out and the message is incomplete then a note
     indicating it's incomplete is placed in the message body or as a text file
     attachment.
 7.  The client is notified of either the message being queued or a connection
     timeout condition.

*** Phase 1 ***
 8.  The connecting IP address is checked against all the IP ranges in the
     Domain Configuration file and the message is white or black listed as
     necessary.  This is logged as step "1".
 9.  The connecting IP address is checked against the outbreak list of IP's that
     have been automatically black listed base on a outbreak recipient address.
     If the item has not been white listed or black listed by this point then
     the recipient addresses are checked against the outbreak recipients in the
     Domain Configuration file.  If any of the recipients are suspect then the
     IP address is automatically added to the outbreak list and the message is
     black listed.  The OutbreakCheck option must be turned on for this step to
     execute.  This is logged as step "+".
10.  The e-mail address in the MAIL FROM: command is checked against the Domain
     Configuration file.  This is logged as step "2".
11.  The saved e-mail message is opened and parsed.  If the message is white
     listed by IP address then this step is only used to extract the subject
     line.  Actions 11-17 are logged as step "3".
12.  Any message header elements that may indicate a sending or return e-mail
     address are checked against the Domain Configuration file.  These include
     Message-ID:, Reply-To:, Unsubscribe:, etc.
13.  If the message header contains any of the tags indicated by the RejectTags
     configuration option, or if the same address is used in both the MAIL FROM:
     and RCPT TO: commands then the message is black listed.  The
     RejectIfSameFromAndTo configuration option also relates to this step.
14.  All address domains, found in the previous step or in the MAIL FROM:
     command, are resolved to IP addresses and checked against black listed IP
     ranges.  Messages will not be white listed on this step.  The
     ForwardResolution configuration option must be turned on for this step to
     take place.
15.  The e-mail address indicated with the From: element is verified to exist
     and validated with basic format checks.  Messages with invalid or
     non-existent From: elements are black listed.  The RejectIfFromInvalid and
     AcceptBlankMailFrom configuration options relate to this step.
16.  If the message body is MIME encoded in Base16, Base32 or Base64 then it's
     decoded.  Multiple text and HTML sections are decoded and merged as
     necessary.  Carriage Return and Line Feed characters are removed and
     converted to spaces.
17.  The subject line is decoded, if necessary, and all non-standard ASCII
     characters such as Å, Ä and Ã are converted to their standard ASCII
     equivalent.  All non-visible characters such as tabs and NULLs are
     converted to spaces.
18.  The subject line is checked against the Keyword Configuration file.  This
     is logged as step "4".
19.  Any extra spaces are removed from the subject line and it's checked against
     the Keyword Configuration file again.  This is logged as step "5".
20.  If the message isn't already black listed or white listed by IP address then
     a reverse resolution is done with the connecting IP address and the result
     is checked against the Domain Configuration file.  Messages will not be
     white listed on this step.  The ReverseResolution configuration option must
     be turned on for this step to take place.  Actions 20-21 are logged as step
     "6".
21.  If any of the address domains, found in the message header or in the MAIL
     FROM: command, are found to be on the suspect domain list then a reverse
     resolution is done on the sending IP address.  If the result does not also
     resolve to a suspect domain then the message is black listed.  This helps
     prevent spammers from spoofing common return address domains such as
     yahoo.com and hotmail.com.  The ReverseResolution configuration option must
     be turned on for this step to take place.

*** Phase 2 ***
22.  The connecting IP address is checked against any DNSBL services that are
     configured.  Messages will not be white listed on this step.  The
     DNSBLSource, DNSBLResults and DNSBLAction configuration options relate
     to this step.  This is logged as step "7".
23.  If the message body is blank and there are no attachments then the message
     is black listed.  The AcceptBlankBody configuration option must be turned
     off for this step to take place.  This is logged as step "8".
24.  HTML notation in the message body such as "%09", "&#%03d;" and "&yacute;"
     are converted to ASCII characters.  If the number of alphanumeric characters
     converted exceeds the EncodingLimit value then the message is black listed.
     Messages will be taken off the white list if this format is found.  The
     EncodingLimit value must also be greater than zero.  Actions 24-26 are
     logged as step "9".
25.  All non-standard ASCII characters in the message body such as Å, Ä and Ã
     are converted to their standard ASCII equivalent.  All non-visible
     characters such as tabs and NULLs are converted to spaces.
26.  The message body is checked against the Keyword Configuration file.  At
     this step the percent complete indicated by the STAT command will be
     between 0% and 50%.
27.  All HTTP links in the message body are extracted, revolved to IP addresses
     and checked against black listed IP ranges.  Also if any of the links found
     exceed the specified MaxLinkSize or are found to contain deceptive
     formatting then the message will be black listed.  Messages will not be
     white listed on this step.  Deceptive link formatting will remove messages
     from the white list.  This helps prevent spammers concealing their identity
     by registering hundreds of random domain names, using hacked slave computers
     and spoofing return addresses to get passed spam filters.  The
     ForwardResolution configuration option must be turn on for this step to take
     place.  Actions 27-29 are logged as step "A".
28.  All HTML tags and extra spaces are removed from the message body.  This
     helps defeat common tricks to fragment messages by adding invisible code.
29.  The message body is checked one last time against the Keyword Configuration
     file.  At this step the percent complete indicated by the STAT command will
     be between 50% and 100%.

*** Finish ***
30.  If step 26 was skipped due to the message being white listed based on a
     keyword or e-mail address then this step is taken just in case something
     was stoofed to get by spam filters.  All HTTP links in the message body are
     extracted, revolved to IP addresses and checked against black listed IP
     ranges.  Also if any of the links found exceed the specified MaxLinkSize
     or are found to contain deceptive formatting then the message will be black
     listed.  Messages will not be white listed on this step.  Deceptive link
     formatting will remove messages from the white list.  The ForwardResolution
     configuration option must be turn on for this step to take place.  This is
     logged as step "B".
31.  If the message is both black listed and white listed then it's assumed to
     be white listed only.
32.  If the message is still black listed then it's either copied to a Turf
     Directory as indicated by the TurfDir configuration option, delivered to a
     spam mailbox as indicated by the ForwardingAddress configuration option, or
     deleted as indicated by the filter option which identified the message.
33.  If the message is white listed, or neither white listed or black listed,
     then it's forwarded to the Smart Host as indicated by the SmartHost and
     SmartHostPort configuration options.  Additional information about the scan
     results is added to the message header.
34.  If the Smart Host rejects the message during delivery then a non-delivery
     report is generated and sent to the address indicated with the MAIL FROM:
     command.  The AdminAddress configuration option is used as the return
     address on non-delivery reports.
35.  If the message is confirmed to be forwarded to the Smart Host, or if the
     non-delivery report is confirmed to be sent, then the message is deleted
     from the Temporary directory.  Otherwise, the message will remain in the
     Temporary directory for an administrator to view it and determine its fate.
     Typically only partially received viruses will remain.
36.  At this point if the client has not disconnected or timed out then it may
     begin sending more SMTP commands and more messages.  It must wait as each
     message it sends is processed to help prevent a denial-of-service attack.

As long as the configuration files are kept up-to-date to block the latest spam
onslaughts then there isn't much spammers can do to get passed SpamHater short
of continually buying new domain names and IP ranges, finding new ways to
slaughter the spelling in their messages, and doing everything they can to
conceal their identities.  SpamHater can't stop them all but it can at least
keep your e-mail more manageable.
